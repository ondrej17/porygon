It is a semestral project for the Python Course at the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics of the
Comenius University in Bratislava, Slovakia.

The main goal of this game is to destroy all marbles in the playground. When three or more marbles
of the same color are connected, they are destroyed. For n destroyed marbles, you get n^2 points.
When there is a single marble disconnected from any other, it gets destroyed and you get 1 point.
The game ends when you either destroy all marbles, or a marble touches the bottom edge.

Good luck!
